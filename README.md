# UnlicensedMailboxesW-In5DaysExpiry
Finds all mailboxes within 5 days of expiration and need Licensed in Office 365 to Continue using email

# Purpose
All migrated mailboxes in 365 have a 30 day grace period before they are required to have a license. If they pass this period then they get soft deleted and can be recovered by giving them a license. This script is to try and catch that around the 25 day mark to avoid having the mailbox deleted.
